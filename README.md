# Dynamic Photo Submission Website 
---
# Overview 
---
## This is a photo submission contest page that allows the user to submit one image to the gallery. The other two image inputs were not implemented and are there since I was replicating the figma file design. The following pages on this site are a index, about, details, and submission page. The skills I used in the project were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It effectively demonstrates the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) to update and interact with elements on the page. I also added a dark mode option that can be toggled on all pages except the index.

### What I learned : 
---
I implemented event listeners in JavaScript to provide a dynamic user experience. These event listeners helped capture user interactions and trigger appropriate actions, making the application interactive and engaging. I also learned how to manipulate the DOM and use the console to make sure I was getting the correct data back.

## I had fun making this project and learned a lot from building this website.
