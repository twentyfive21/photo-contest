## Dynamic Photo Submission Website 
---
## Overview 
### This is a photo submission contest page that allows users to submit images to the gallery. While the design initially included three image inputs, only one is currently implemented to replicate the Figma file design. This project consists of several key pages: an index, about, details, and submission page. The primary technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, a dark mode option has been incorporated, which can be toggled on all pages except the index.
